## Developing Product Application

This is a project that involves developing web applications using shiny. The objective of this project is to produce a web application that encompasses practical application of machine learning. 

The inspiration of this project takes from the ERP software in which users do all of their daily activities inside the system. Here, I created a calculator-like application where users alike can run machine learning at ease and see the results without having to do the coding part. 

The application only runs built-in dataset. For future development, I want to make machine learning more accessible to all users by allowing them to upload data and have the system itself do the processing, running, and finally giving results.
